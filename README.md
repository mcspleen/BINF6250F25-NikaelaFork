# Introduction

This project implements the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) and related algorithms for efficient string processing and pattern matching. The implementation includes:

- **Suffix Array Construction**: Creates a sorted array of all suffix positions in a string
- **BWT Generation**: Computes the Burrows-Wheeler Transform from a suffix array
- **Character Counting Functions**: Calculates cumulative character counts and occurrence maps for efficient pattern searching
- **BWT Inversion**: Reconstructs the original string from its BWT representation

These components form the foundation for advanced text compression and searching algorithms used in bioinformatics applications like genome alignment and sequence analysis.

# Pseudocode
Put pseudocode in this box:

```
def BWT(string: str) -> str:

    Make string into list of individual characters, put $ in last position
    Establish empty nxn matrix where n is len(string)
    For loop for each row:
    	Insert list as the row
        Pop first element and insert that as last element in list

    Take matrix and numpy sort along axis 0 (rows)

    Take last column of matrix and establish that as bwt

    return bwt 

def suffix_array(string: str) -> list[int]:
   
	Create a list of all suffices of the text, each paired with its starting position
	for loop using enumerate for index 
		append sliced string
	
	Sort these suffix-position pairs lexicographically by suffix
	
	Extract just the starting positions from the sorted pairs
	
	Return the list of sorted starting positions


def BWT_from_suffix_array(

	Initialize an empty string of the same length as the input text
	
	for each position in the suffix positions list do
		if the suffix starts at the beginning of the text then
			Add the last character of the text to the transformed result
		else
	 		Add the character preceding the suffix to the transformed result
	
	return the transformed result


from collections import Counter

def cal_count(string: str) -> dict[str, int]:
   
	Initialize a dictionary to track character counts
	
	Initialize a result dictionary for cumulative counts
	Set initial cumulative count to zero
	
	for each character in the sorted alphabet do
	Store the current cumulative count for this character
	Increase the cumulative count by the frequency of this character
	
	make double for loop, comparing current character to all other characters
	adds total from last character if character is smaller than it
	
	return the dictionary of cumulative counts


def cal_occur(bwt_string: str) -> dict[str, list[int]]:
    
	Initialize a dictionary mapping each character to an array of zeros
	
	for each position in the transformed text do
		Identify the character at the current position
	for each character in the alphabet do
		Copy the previous occurrence count to the current position
		Increment the occurrence count for the current character

	return the dictionary of occurrence counts


def update_range(
  lower: int, 
  upper: int, 
  count: dict[str, int], 
  occur: dict[str, list[int]], 
  a: str) -> tuple[int, int]:
   
	Calculate new start position using character's count and occurrences at range start
	Calculate new end position using character's count and occurrences at range end
	return new start and end positions

	We need to find which of the 'a' rows match our search
	We use occur['a'] to count how many 'a's we've seen
	Start at where the 'a' rows begin:

	Add how many 'a's we need to skip based on our current position


def find_match(query: str, reference: str) -> list[int]:
    
	Initialize search range to cover the entire transformed text
	for each character in the pattern, processing from right to left do
		Update the search range based on the current character
		if the range becomes empty then
			return empty list as pattern is not found
	Collect all suffix positions within the final range
	return the list of matching positions
	
	Step 1: Get the BWT and other data structures
	Step 2: Initialize the range
	Step 3: Loop through query backwards
	Update range # Check if empty # Step 4: Collect matching positions # Step 5: Return results

```

# Successes
- **Effective collaboration**: Coordinating with my partner (Jason) to establish clear goals and timelines. We decided to aim for completion by Sunday night, which felt challenging over the weekend but ultimately gave us extra time for code cleanup and optimization.
- **Strong time management**: Finishing ahead of schedule allowed us to refine our implementation and strengthen the codebase. Plus the added benefit of not stressing abou itthe night before 
- **Meeting project objectives**: Successfully implemented all required functions with proper documentation and added some test cases.

# Struggles
- **Conceptual challenges**: Understanding the inverse BWT function and why the algorithm needed to work in reverse order took significant effort.
- **Debugging**: Working through indentation errors and logical bugs in the initial implementations required careful attention to detail.
- **Algorithm complexity**: Grasping how the different components (suffix arrays, character counts, occurrence maps) work together in the larger BWT framework.

# Personal Reflections
## Group Leader(Nikaela Aitken)
This project went pretty smoothly overall. I made a conscious decision not to repeat my approach from last week! instead, I invested time in reading documentation and watching educational videos to better understand the BWT algorithm conceptually before diving into the code. This preparation paid off, as I was able to grasp the underlying logic more thoroughly and contribute more effectively to the implementation. I really appreciate Jason being so on board to try and get this project done Sunday night as I knew my work week was going to be very busy. He was a great partner and we split up the functions and worked off our pseudocode. I was very grateful that so much pseudocode was provided. I think conceptually this was a harder topic and it was a relief that the proejct actually felt doable rather than smothering. 


## Other member (Jason Bae)
As Marcus told us, the main struggle for this project was wrapping our heads around the concept and not the coding. That said, learning about memory efficient algorithms and how to read/unpack those was very fascinating to me. This project went smoothly- Nikaela and I were able to get the main bulk of the project done by Sunday with small refinements following it. I appreciate that despite a busy schedule, Nikaela maintains open communication and solid work.
